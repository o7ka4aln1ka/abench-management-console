**Implementig BigBench2**

This is my master thesis project. The main idea is to make installing and implementing BigBench2 Benchmark easier and to automate the process as much as possible.

Using python3.6, flask and some other tools there will be created a WebUI for easier control over BigBench.

**Pre-requirements: **

*  Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
*  python 3.6.x
*  flask - latest version
